### CSCI E-65 Mobile Application Development Using Swift and iOS
#### Mobile Application Development Using Swift and iOS

Spring Term 2016 CRN 24588

This intensive course surveys mobile application development using cutting-edge Apple technologies: the Swift language (v. 2.0), the Xcode 7 IDE, and the iOS platform. The curriculum blends Swift's powerful feature set with universal design patterns such as Model-View-Controller and asynchronous Internet communication. Students design their interfaces using storyboarding, a powerful design technique that provides immediate visual feedback. We progress from the core "UIKit" to other iOS Frameworks such as MapKit and AVFoundation, as well as third party frameworks that support social media and cloud database storage. Weekly assignments progress from basic programming to realistic app development. There is an emphasis on commented, carefully-crafted code.
