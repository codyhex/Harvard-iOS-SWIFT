- Stackoverflow

- Apple MemberCenter

Downside: 
For the first two, they are search engine based and have a huge mount of questions, by filleting keywords can quickly look into the thing I want but sometimes **hard to describe the issue** and other people’s problem may not the one you want.

For the Last three, document based resources, to handle these book, the first thing I need is to know where is the problem and without reading or getting into swift for a deep look, it’s hard to tell what problem is, where should I look up. Furthermore is the reading, and I sometime don’t understand what going on in the book.
